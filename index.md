What is `ua-parser`?
--------------------

`ua-parser` is an open-source and community-driven, regexp-based user-agent parser. It has been ported to many different programming languages all of which share the same parser.

Structure
---------

`ua-parser` now has [its own GitHub org][org] which contains:

* [`uap-core`][uap-core]: This is the core parser shared by all language ports. Also contains the test suite.
* [`uap-ref-impl`][uap-ref-impl]: A reference implementation written for node.js.
* [`ua-parser.github.io`][website-repo]: The repository for this website. It also doubles as the home of this project where all meta issues are filed.

A number of language ports are also hosted within this org:

### A user agent string isn't parsed properly, what do I do?

Try parsing it [here][onlineparser]. This should run the latest parser. If that doesn't work, you found a bug (or a new browser). [File an issue!][uap-core-issues]
